                <p>In 1792 the first publicly held hotel, called the Sunset Lodge, opened in NYC. The first hotel in the
                    present sense of the word, the Tremont House, opened in Boston in 1829. It was a quite remarkable
                    place,
                    that set many “firsts” for the industry. Most notably it was the first hotel with indoor plumbing
                    and
                    indoor toilets and baths.</p>
                <p>It was also the pioneer in terms of reception as well as everyone’s favourite
                    – free soap. Another big milestone is the creation of the first business hotel, the Buffalo Statler,
                    in
                    1908.</p>

                <p>Nothing makes you feel better than when you get into a hotel bed, and the sheets feel so good. Why
                    shouldn't you wake up like that every day? Spend money on your mattress and bedding because these
                    things make a difference on your sleep and, ultimately, your happiness.</p>

                <p>When you come to a hotel room, you want it to be grand, functional and beautiful. But you don't want
                    things that are not useful. Sometimes you go to hotels and there are all these frames and pictures
                    of people you don't know, and you end up hiding everything in the drawer, and then housekeeping come
                    and put it out again.</p>
